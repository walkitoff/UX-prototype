    <h1>Transportation</h1>
    
    <h2>Arriving</h2>
    <p>
    Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow
     Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and 
     propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on 
     the island within the next few years. 
    </p>
    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Public buses (5 a.m.â€“11 p.m.)</li>
      <li>Private buses across the island</li>
      <li>Taxis in Taniti City</li>
      <li>Rental cars near the airport</li>
      <li>Bikes with helmets (required)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Taniti City is flat and walkable. Merriton Landing is especially easy to explore on foot.</p>
