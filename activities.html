    <h1>Activities</h1>

    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <p>
        Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and visit the volcano. 
        However, there are other things to do, including visiting a local history museum, going on chartered 
        fishing tours, snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery, 
        dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art 
        galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year. Many of these 
        activities are in Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay. 
    </p>
    <h2>Sightseeing</h2>

        Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, 
        which boasts native architecture and nearby white, 
        sandy beaches that encircle Yellow Leaf Bay.
